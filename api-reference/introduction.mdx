# Welcome to the FlowScale's ComfyUI API

Welcome to the **FlowScale's ComfyUI API**, your gateway to orchestrating and managing sophisticated workflows seamlessly across multiple ComfyUI instances. Designed with scalability, reliability, and flexibility in mind, this API empowers developers and organizations to automate complex processes, handle dynamic inputs, and efficiently manage resources within a robust infrastructure.

## What is FlowScale's ComfyUI API?

The **FlowScale's ComfyUI API** is tailored to interact with ComfyUI instances deployed within a FlowScale cluster. It facilitates the execution of workflows that may involve various tasks such as data processing, file handling, and integration with cloud services. By leveraging this API, users can programmatically initiate, monitor, and retrieve the results of their workflows with ease.

## Key Features

- **Health Monitoring:** Continuously check the status of all ComfyUI instances to ensure optimal performance and uptime.
- **Queue Management:** Retrieve and manage queue data for running and pending tasks across ComfyUI instances.
- **Workflow Execution:** Execute complex workflows with dynamic form data, including support for file uploads and text inputs.
- **Run Tracking:** Monitor the status and details of each workflow execution, ensuring transparency and traceability.
- **Output Retrieval:** Access the results of your workflows, whether they are images, videos, audio files, or text data, with secure download links.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Automatically balances load across available ComfyUI instances based on real-time queue sizes.
- **Secure Access:** Implements robust API key authentication to safeguard your workflows and data.

## Security and Authentication

Security is paramount in the FlowScale Comfy API. All endpoints are protected using **API Key Authentication**, ensuring that only authorized users can access and interact with the API. The API key must be included in the request headers as follows:

- **Header Name:** `X-API-KEY`
- **Header Value:** Your unique API key (string)

### Authentication Flow

1. **API Key Validation:** Each request must include a valid API key. The API validates this key and then allows access to the relevant data on successful authentication.
2. **Access Control:** If the API key is missing, invalid, or does not match the expected value, the API will respond with appropriate error messages (`401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`).

## Getting Started
