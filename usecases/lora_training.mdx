title: Training LoRAs on Flowscale
description: This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on how to train LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations) using Flowscale. You'll learn how to deploy a ComfyUI workflow, set up necessary environment variables, and train your LoRA through an API. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a trained LoRA uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket and accessible within your Flowscale environment.

### a. Create or Use an Existing S3 Bucket

1. **Access AWS S3:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to **Services** > **S3**.

2. **Create a Bucket:**
   - Click on **Create bucket**.
   - Enter a unique **Bucket name**.
   - De-select "Block All Public Access"

   - Scroll to bottom and click **Create bucket**.


### b. Make the Bucket Public

1. **Bucket Permissions:**
   - Click on your bucket.
   - Go to the **Permissions** tab.
   - Set the following Bucket Policy
   ```
   {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your_bucket_name/*"
        }
      ]
   }
   ```
> **Note:** Replace *your_bucket_name* with your own bucket name in the Bucket Policy


   - Set the following Cross-origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS)
   ```
   [
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"

## 6. Train the LoRA via API

With your workflow deployed and environment variables set, you can now train the LoRA.

### a. Retrieve Your API Key

1. **Access API Keys:**
   - In your Flowscale project, go to **Deployment Dashboard** or **Project Settings**.
   - Copy your **API URL** and **API Key**

<img src="https://flowscale-prod.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Screenshot+2024-10-27+164922.png"/>


### b. Prepare Your API Request

- **Endpoint URL:** Use the *API URL* provided after deployment.
- **HTTP Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:**
  - `X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY`
  - `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
- **Form Data:**
  - `images_lora_trainer`: Upload your images here.
  - `lora_name`: The desired output LoRA name.

### c. Example API Request Using cURL

```bash
curl --location 'https://your_api_url.pod.flowscale.ai/api/v1/runs?workflow_id=your_workflow_id&group_id=your_group_id' \
--header 'X-API-Key: your_api_key' \
--form 'images_lora_trainer=@/path/to/image1.jpg" \
--form 'images_lora_trainer=@/path/to/image2.jpg" \
--form 'images_lora_trainer=@/path/to/image3.jpg" \
--form 'lora_name="test_lora_001"'
```

> **Note:** The *group_id* can be used to fetch list of **Runs** belonging to the same group.

### d. Steps to Train

1. **Collect Training Images:**
   - Gather all images for training.

2. **Execute API Request:**
   - Use cURL or any API client (e.g., Postman) to send the request.
   - The API will process the images and start training.
   - Training time may vary based on image quantity and size.

## 7. Access and Use the Generated LoRA

### a. Verify LoRA in S3 Bucket

1. **Check S3 Bucket:**
   - Go to your AWS S3 bucket.
   - Look for the newly generated LoRA file.

2. You can also view the training details on the **Runs** Tab inside the project. You can view the training images and also download the trained model

### b. Use LoRA in Flowscale Workflows

1. **Access Flowscale Volume:**
   - The LoRA is added to your Flowscale Private volume automatically.

2. **Integrate LoRA into other workflows:**
   - In your workflows, reference the LoRA by its name.
