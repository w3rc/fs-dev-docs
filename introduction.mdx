FlowScale is a **no-code/low-code platform** designed for running **ComfyUI** on cloud GPUs, enabling users to build, manage, and deploy **AI-powered workflows** as scalable, serverless **APIs** or shareable **AI applications (Gradio UIs)**. Whether you're an AI artist, developer, designer, or founder, FlowScale provides a collaborative and intuitive environment to create AI workflows without the need to manage complex infrastructure.

This documentation will guide you through everything you need to know—from getting started with FlowScale to advanced topics like managing workflows, deploying APIs, and scaling applications.

## **What is FlowScale?**

FlowScale is a platform that simplifies the process of building and deploying **AI solutions** based on ComfyUI workflows. By providing an integrated cloud environment, FlowScale empowers users to:

- **Run ComfyUI on cloud GPUs**: No more local hardware limitations—use FlowScale’s cloud infrastructure to process large AI workflows quickly.
- **Collaborate on workflows**: Work with your team to build and manage AI workflows in real time.
- **Deploy workflows as APIs**: Turn your AI workflows into scalable, serverless APIs that can be integrated into applications.
- **Create shareable AI apps with Gradio UIs**: Build interactive AI applications that can be shared via simple URLs, without requiring end-users to install any software.

---

## **Key Features**

### 1. **No-code/Low-code Workflow Builder**
FlowScale allows users to design and execute AI workflows without writing any code. The intuitive **ComfyUI** interface lets you visually connect different components (nodes) to build powerful AI models.

- **Drag-and-drop node editor**: Build workflows by connecting pre-built components.
- **Custom nodes**: Extend your workflows with custom nodes that suit your specific AI needs.
- **Workflow versioning**: Save and track different versions of your workflows, allowing for easy collaboration and experimentation.

### 2. **Cloud GPU Infrastructure**
FlowScale takes the hassle out of infrastructure management by providing access to powerful cloud GPUs, including **T4, L4, A100, and H100 GPUs**, allowing users to scale their workflows efficiently.

- **Choose from multiple GPU types** based on your performance needs.
- **Seamless scaling**: Run large AI models and workflows without worrying about hardware limitations.
- **GPU management**: Monitor GPU usage and optimize workflows for faster execution.

### 3. **Collaborative Environment**
FlowScale is designed for teams to collaborate on building AI workflows. Multiple users can work on the same project, with built-in **version control** and **role-based access**.

- **Project-based collaboration**: Add team members to projects with specific permissions (owners, collaborators).
- **GitHub integration**: Each FlowScale project is backed by a **GitHub repository**, ensuring all workflows and custom nodes are securely versioned and accessible.

### 4. **API and Gradio UI Deployments**
FlowScale simplifies the deployment of AI workflows into scalable APIs and shareable UIs.

- **Deploy as APIs**: Transform AI workflows into APIs with one click, complete with **auto-generated API documentation (Swagger)**.
- **Gradio UIs**: Deploy workflows as **interactive AI applications** that can be shared via public URLs, enabling users to access your AI models with ease.
- **Scalability**: Built-in scalability features ensure that your APIs can handle increasing traffic seamlessly.

### 5. **Advanced Workflow Management**
With FlowScale, you have complete control over your workflows:

- **I/O Configuration**: Configure input/output nodes for seamless API and UI integration.
- **Model and node management**: Manage AI models and custom nodes across projects and workflow versions.
- **Monitor deployments**: Track the performance and usage of deployed workflows through logs and other monitoring tools.

## **Who is FlowScale For?**

FlowScale is designed for a wide range of users, from **AI developers** to **non-technical creators**. Here's how FlowScale benefits different user groups:

- **AI Artists**: Run and deploy AI models like Stable Diffusion or custom generative AI workflows, all from the cloud.
- **Founders & Business Leaders**: Leverage FlowScale’s powerful AI infrastructure to deploy machine learning models as services without needing in-depth technical knowledge.
- **Designers**: Experiment with cutting-edge AI tools and workflows to integrate into design projects, all without touching code.
- **Developers**: Use FlowScale’s API deployment tools to integrate AI models into applications, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## **How Does FlowScale Work?**

FlowScale is built to streamline every aspect of AI workflow management and deployment. Here's a brief overview of how the platform works:

1. **Create a Project**: Start by creating a project where your workflows, models, and nodes will be stored. Each project is backed by a GitHub repository, ensuring version control and collaboration.
2. **Build or Import a Workflow**: Use the drag-and-drop interface of ComfyUI to build a workflow, or import an existing one. You can configure custom nodes, models, and inputs/outputs.
3. **Configure Inputs and Outputs**: Before deployment, define the inputs and outputs of your workflow. This configuration allows for seamless API and UI creation.
4. **Deploy as an API or Gradio UI**: With just a few clicks, deploy your workflow as a **scalable API** or a **shareable Gradio UI**. FlowScale automatically generates API documentation and provides links for Gradio UIs.
5. **Monitor and Scale**: After deployment, use FlowScale’s monitoring tools to track usage and optimize performance. Ensure your workflow scales based on user demand.

## Workflows
When you open a Project, in FlowScale, you will find yourself in a view like below. This is the Editor Tab.

<Frame caption="Editor Tab">
  <img
    className="block rounded-lg"
    src="/images/introduction/editor.png"
    alt="Editor"
  />
</Frame>

Workflows are the core building blocks of FlowScale. A workflow in FlowScale is nothing but a json file that you get when you save a workflow on ComfyUI. */}
