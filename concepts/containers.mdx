Containers are the lowest possible unit of deployment in Flowscale. Each cluster comprises one or more containers, which can be used for autoscaling GPUs based on queue size.

## Key Features
  - Lightweight Execution Units: Containers package your workflows with all dependencies.
  - Scalable: Easily add or remove containers to meet demand.
  - Isolation: Each container runs independently, ensuring consistent performance.

## How to Use Projects

1. Configure Containers in Clusters:
  - When setting up a cluster, specify the number of containers by modifying the **Allotted GPU Containers** in the *Pod GPU Settings*
  - Set **Queue Size Limit** to specify the queue size upon reaching which, a new ComfyUI instance will spawn.

## Benefits
  - Fine-grained control over deployment units.
  - Ability to scale specific components of your application.
  - Consistency across different environments.
