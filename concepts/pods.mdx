Pods in Flowscale act like personal computers or servers that host your ComfyUI instances. They are the execution environment where your workflows run.

## Key Features
  - Dedicated Resources: Each pod has allocated CPU, memory, and GPU resources.
  - Isolation: Pods are isolated from each other, ensuring security and performance.
  - Customization: Configure pods to meet the specific requirements of your workflows.

## How to Use Pods

1. Access Pods:
  - Go to the Pods section in Flowscale.

2. Create a New Pod:
  - Click on Create New Pod or select an existing pod
  - Select the configuration (e.g., GPU type, generation timeout, etc).
  
3. Assign Workflows to Pods:
  - Link your projects or workflows to a pod for execution.

## Benefits
  - Control over the execution environment.
  - Ability to scale resources as needed.
  - Isolation ensures stable and secure workflow execution.
