Runs are single execution records within a container. Each time you execute a workflow through Flowscale's ComfyUI API, a new run is created.

## Key Features
  - Execution Tracking: Record inputs, outputs, and other metadata of each execution
  - Historical Data: Track past runs for analytical purposes

## How to Use Runs

  - Run your workflow through the API calls or the API Playground

2. View Run Details:
  - Navigate to the Runs tab in your project.
  - Select a run to view its details.

3. Analyze Results:
